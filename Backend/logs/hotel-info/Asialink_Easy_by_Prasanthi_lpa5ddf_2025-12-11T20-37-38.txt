Areas for Improvement:
• Limited parking
• Expensive breakfast

• Have to pay for some extra cost if you need an extra towel for your kid
• Difficult to park
• Breakfast not spread out, and the food was not up to our standard. Can be better with more choices for breakfast.
• There was very minimum choices on the 1st day and even lesser on the 2nd day of stay. Noodles were dry. No meat on both days served for breakfast. Food could have been better.
• We had issue with hair dryer every night, as it would stop working. Feedback to staff they tried to fix it but the problem persisted. End up we also almost give up then we discovered that issues was with the socket. It would be helpful if they checked the socket next time to avoid similar problem.
• Good Luck
